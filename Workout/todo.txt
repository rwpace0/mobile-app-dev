wtf going on

make db have progress rows with sets reps and weight

still need per user db
merge both dbs with ui

need to load exercise data locally on open
check for new exercises depending on last date created

async function getLastSyncedAt() {
  return (await AsyncStorage.getItem('lastSyncedAt')) || '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z';
}
async function setLastSyncedAt(ts) {
  await AsyncStorage.setItem('lastSyncedAt', ts);
}

write to local db right when user adds something new
push that into db after

using react-native-sqlite-storage for local storage

sync somehow

after this store the exercise progress

make active workout with timer

the user can create their own workout templates that will store somehow with db
temlates just a list of exercises they chose and their recent progress

ui and styles needs a complete redo its so bad
